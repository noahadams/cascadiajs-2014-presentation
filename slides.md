# CascadiaJS 2014
## What was that all about?

---

# CascadiaSJ 2014
- Single-track, community-organized Javascript conference for the Pacific Northwest
- Two big themes:
    - Technology
    - Culture

---

# The Plan:
    - Cover some highlights from both themes
    - Steal some demos for wow factor

---
# Culture:
    - Community Building
    - Mentorship & Learning
    - Diversity

---
# Community Building
- Interesting and contrasting viewpoints on meetups from
    - Jason Campbell [@jxson](http://www.twitter.com/jxson), formerly of [http://js.la](http://js.la/)
    - Jason Rhodes [@rhodesjason](http://www.twitter.com/rhodesjason), from Baltimore NodeSchool

# On Organising Meetups:
- Successful meet-ups are continued, with good leadership, as opposed to wildly popular and with famous speakers
- Provide a professional support network, more diverse than just your co-workers
- Don't worry about everything being perfect, just make sure the content is good and the venue sufficient
- Have a clear vision, and don't pander to noobies (but be welcoming)
- Ask for help, and lots of it, co-ordinate with related meet-ups
- Maybe don't use meetup.com, it's a den of opportunists
- But tolerate recruiters if they play nice
- Sponsors are good too, pizza for 80 people gets expensive, but balance their interests with the audience's
- Run regularly, with a halfway consistent schedule
- Produce artifacts: videos and photos, they will promote the content and the meet-up
- Provide extra time and space for socializing, ensure there's an organized after-event

# On Building Baltimore NodeSchool
- An alternative model for building programming community
- The lecture format can be alienating to beginners, and doesn't itself provide for much interaction
- Not everyone has 4 hours to commit after work to attending talks and hanging out at a bar
- NodeSchool is an *open source* tutor style meet up held on weekends
- Mentors and learners are paired up, and complete a project together
- Mentors and learners both seem to *love* it
- We all have different starting points with programming and the industry, and where they are is largely a matter of privilege
- Build inclusive communities that are conscious of that fact
- NodeSchool works well for people of various ages and motivations
- Also, consider providing childcare for your events, it opens them up hugely

# Mentorship and Barriers to Entry
- Talks by:
    - Ruth Baril [@dark_roast_ruth](http://www.twitter.com/dark_roast_ruth) on Barriers to Entry
    - Marlena Compton and Ryan Dy on Hacking Mentor.js

# Barriers to Entry
 
## When learning programming isn't the hard part
 
- Programming is great work that pays well, and learning to program is increasingly easy to start
- Successful careers in the past !== seamless entry into life as a programmer
- Communities, be they professional or open source, aren't particularly welcoming to newcomers
- Newcomers have Unrealistic Expectations: knowing terminology, code -> production is complicated, nothing is transparent
- Be more welcoming to newcomers by:
    - See someone alone at a meet up? try talking to them
    - Offer to answer questions and share your stories
    - Don't ridicule popular resources (e.g. w3schools, but don't be afraid to point out why they might be bad)

# Hacking Mentorship.js
 
- Mentorships have value for the Mentor and Mentee, teachning and learning are both very satisfying
- Beyond learning and technical skill, mentorship is about instilling confidence
- A good mentor is someone who can be asked questions without making judgements about the asker
