# Cascadia JS 2014!

- Intro remarks by @hackygolucky
- Allen introduces himself and attempts to be hype man

## What we paln for is never what actually happens
- @willowbl00
- Technology as a means to equality
- Who are the most marginalized people who might use that thing? Build it with them in mind and things will probably work for everyone else
- resource allocation for disaster scenarios is centralised and often poorly organised
- witht he internet you can use ecommerce wishlists as an enabler for mutual aid, as happenned with "Occupy Sandy" in New York
- interesting story about process of building a gendered violence relief hotline's information system in Haiti
- In Tanzania, there is a chaotic, decentralized water infrastructure of "water points", built featurephone compatible application for reporting broken water points, which enabled reportingand a real idea about the state of the water infrastructure
- Disasters are messy, lots of organiationsand individuals trying to help, and they coordinate poorly, "Badges" enable a cross situational credential for doing a thing
- geob.org/donate
- codesign toolkit for building thingswithan intended userbase

## Everything you never wanted to know about maps
- @patrickarlt
- Visalize, analyze and interpret spatial data
- Customers in government, utilities, telecomm and disaster response agencies
- Bring people doing crazy advanced GIS stuff and software developers together
- different jargon coming into the company
- Map Projections: how to flatten the earth
- Surfaces -> planes, cylinders, cone, each one preserves differnet combinations of angle, distance, etc.
- Azimuthal: project around a point and distance to that point will be preserved
- Mercator projections preserve course at sea!
- Equal Area maps preserve proportions of spaces
- Dymaxion: project onto a D20
- Google Mercator puzzle lets you see how things distort in the mercator projection from poles to equator
- Spatial Reference systems: Geographic Coordinate system -> projected coordinate system
- unit measurement, prime meridian, which spheroid model of the earth are you using?
- A datum, control points
- Projected coordinate system: plot x/y pairs ontoa  flat surface, x = longitude, y = lattitude
- Web mercator: default in google maps, leaflet and esri
- "State Plane System" - a common format for geodata in the US
- libraries ogr2ogr, pro4js
- work in geoJSON!
- convert from esri shape files to geoJSON
- spatialrefernce.org
- webgl + openstreetmap + vector tiles!
- demos adaptive projection maps
- esri is working on 3d mapping, shows demo of recreation of jfk assasination including bullet trajectories and texas school book depository.                                               

## Contributors wanted: increasing diversity in open source projects
- @k88hudeson
- diversity is a source of success
- what is diversity? what makes it the secret sauce for open source?
- identity diversity: gender, ethnicity, religious and political beliefs
- cognitive diversity also very important!
- we don't talk much about how being/thinking differently can be good collectively, for groups
- diversity trumps ability?
- cognitively diverse groups outperform experienced ones
- diversity makes a difference in disjunctive tasks, where group performance is depenedent on its strongest member
- diversity of experience matters for open source
- split your code base up into simpler modules that can be worked on independently
- consider a code of conduct to handle conflict amongst contributors
- consider taking contribution beyond code: e.g. user research
- Does my software do what I think it does?
- Formalize your expectations of how you expect your users to interact and validate them or reformulate them or change the software!
- pro tip: you only need about 5 sessions to get useul data out of user testing
- cognitive diversity will highlight different things from the results of user testing
- Transifex is a community localaization and translation platform
- moment.js has good localization
- mozilla popcorn maker rejigs its layout in arabic, a right to left language
- making good software is hard, and cognitive diversity is too valuable for you not to care                                                     

## Organising a successful user group
- @jxson
- used to run js.la
- successful: means continues and long lasting with good leadership, as opposed to big/famous/lots of speakers
- provides a professional support group
- more diverse than the people you work with
- stitch-n-bitch: it can be helpful to just talk
- the idea of being a craftsperson with a guild/union
- speaking candidly with professionals you don't work with directly can be good
- being completely immersed in developer culture is probably not good for yout hough
- community/culture are intagible, they're something you take part in making
- you need to be a willing participant and collaborator, not an opportunist
- what's good is subjective to the audience, you 
- DIY, like bad punk and hardcore bands
- it doesn't have to be perfect
- you can take any place and make it yours, you just have to have the desire and the people in place
- "your people" are not from here
- tech is not just for people with time and access
- why aren't things better in my town? content, leadership and consistency
- the talks in LA were bad at some point, lots of intro to X framework
- it was work to start js.la, but things went halfway smoothly after that
- don't ask for permission, ask for help!
- but don't intentionally step on toes either, don't start a gang war over what nights you run
- have a clear vision
- don't pander to the status quo, push things past mediocrity
- BUT also be responsive to feedback
- Don't cater to beginners, instead nurture a community that is welcoming
- Blow people's minds, or at least try to
- Remeber, programming is supposed to be fun
- Be excited as an organizer, create things that inspire you
- Book speakers in advance, up to 3 months, they can and do cancel, more time gives you a cahnce to find a backup
- Venues don't need to be perfect, just big enough
- Treat venues like sponsors, exchange their time and space for something
- don't burn out, ask for help, lots of help
- Join forces: LA Devops, spec.la, Data Viz LA
- Seeking consensus is the enemy of getting things done, split things up and let them run autonomously, trust
- Have a single, omni-directional information authority
- Get sponsors, pizza for 80 people adds up, be clear what you want from and offer to sponsors
- It's ok to have more than one sponsor
- Balance sponsor's interest with audience's time and attention
- Food and beverages: 2 slices and 1.5 beers is a good rule of thumb (also bring water)
- beer is nice, but not crucial
- (Maybe) don't use meetup.com or other places where recruiters and other opportunists lurk
- Recruiters can sometimes be ok though, if they are otherwise good participants
- but really, don't tolerate opportunists
- Be consistent, don't be confusing
- Produce Artifacts: record videos, take pictures, useful to others, your sponsors, your future speakers
- provide extra time and space: drinks.js
- IF you build it, they will come
- jason campbell, google

## Web Componenets vs. GIFs
- @GlennMaddern
- Glen Maldern
- saw vastImg
- ETOOMUCHPORN
- GifCity + tumblr = giflove
- DJGif matches Gifs to music
- you can't control much via the img tag
- but aha moment occurs, a gif is nothing but a series of frames
- animated gif is a headers, a series of frames and a footer
- gifexploder.js
- all frames in the DOM, show hide with a little css and js
-geelen.github.io/x-gif, that wrapped ina polymer component
- Dreamcode: API is the best expression of your intent
- The API of a web componenet is the most important part, it dictates to the user what is possible
- Polymer vulcanize, a build tool for web components, inlines js, css and html
- polymer is a framework itself, has opinions about structure and re-use
- Shadow DOM is badass and frameworks don't quite play nice with it yet
- Chrome 36: 300 million people will have access to web components
- platform.js is a shim for web componenets on lots of other browsers
- the difference between polymer componenets and web components is native reach and interaction with other frameworks, you have created an extension of the browser
- Even React.js has to talk to html elements 

## HCI, Open Source and Graph Theory
- @indexzero, ceo nodejitsu
- Recently a Master of Human Computer Interaction
- Tron, he fights for the user
- HCI and static analysis, why?
- why is npm a worthy HCI topic? giant user base you can get stats from
- small group of 8 experts
- Likert scales?
- Various things you can do before a breaking change: gh issue, tweet, mailing list, look at what is most effective
- most effective methods are the least used (and most effort)
- G.R.E.A.M. Graphs Rule Everything Around Me
- Dependency Graphs
- With npm it doesn't tell you much to look at it visually, but does provide you a basis for a search problem
- Explodes with 80 000 packages and hundreds of versions
- gets easier to think about if we restrict to latest version
- people who depend on A also depend on....
- codependencies answer the question by counting how often things are depended on together
- rank codependencies by how often they occur
- shows graph, size of arc is relative popularity, chords between represent magnitude of codependency relationship, colour shows "dominance"
- codeps.jit.su
- browsenpm.org
- nixon popularised idea of fear of a silent majority, "squeeky wheel gets the grease"
- use esprima to quantify use of modules, show hottest methods
- checkout winston
- lets you quantify the "silent majority"
